            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of this little Tract is not to make or Widen any <hi>Breaches:</hi> But rather to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſome Endeavours towards the <hi>Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of thoſe <hi>Wounds</hi> which Angry men delight ſtill to Vex and Torture: Nor would I Expoſe <hi>Prayer</hi> as Cheap and Contemptible to any, But make it Eaſy and <hi>Familiar</hi> to all. That ſuch as have but little Liſt to it, or Kindneſs for it, may ſee what <hi>Need</hi> there is of it, and be Quickened to it: And that others who have more Inclination this way, but find many <hi>Rubs</hi> and Perplexities lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:151193:3"/>them, may ſee the <hi>Paſſage clear'd,</hi> and perceive that there are no ſuch Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in it, but what any ordinary man, who means well, may Eaſily deal with: And ſo be Encouraged to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, And not Drag on Heavily, but find the Duty a Delight, And <hi>Serve the Lord with Gladneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs the firſt <hi>Occaſion</hi> of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was given by ſome Paſſages in Two <hi>Sermons</hi> upon <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> V. 2. Preach'd and lately Publiſh'd by a Reverend and Learned <hi>Doctor,</hi> whoſe Name I forbear to mention, Not for dread of a <hi>Stab</hi> from his Pen: But out of Regard to his Perſon, as well as Place, both upon the Account of what I have heard him, long ago, ſpeak from the Pulpit, in Defence of the Faith, Doctrine and Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in her <hi>Articles:</hi> And alſo what I have ſeen, of late, in ſome of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings from the Preſs, to the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: Particularly his juſt <hi>Zeal</hi> to Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the Goſpel-Doctrine of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:151193:3"/>Saviour's <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> againſt the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſh</hi> Principles of ſuch as imploy their Parts and Wit to <hi>Ridicule</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Nor do I take upon me any Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the main Contents of thoſe very <hi>Sermons,</hi> in which yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that I make bold to Reflect on. For as I know how greatly they are in <hi>Vogue</hi> with many, (who perhaps may like the <hi>Eriſtical</hi> ſquabling Subject, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than they do the old <hi>Anti-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant</hi> Author:) So I profeſs my ſelf Beholden to him, for ſome curious <hi>Notions</hi> I learned from them: And do find a great deal more, wherein I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>Subſcribe</hi> and <hi>Conſent</hi> to him: And all along, give him the due praiſe of his exact Method, his elaborate Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods, his ſurprizing Turns of Wit, and Quickneſs of Expreſſion. But there are other Words and Things he has dropt here and there, which, in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, ſeem not ſo agreeable to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Goſpel: at which indeed I have ſtumbled: and am afraid they
<pb facs="tcp:151193:4"/>may have but a ſorry Effect, in giving Prejudice to many more conſiderable than my ſelf: Yea to give the <hi>Enemies of the Lord occaſion to Blaſpheme:</hi> And to ſtartle the pious Souls of Weak Chriſtians, and make them afraid to <hi>Stand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made us Free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not every florid <hi>Harangue</hi> trimm'd with <hi>Witticiſms,</hi> and pointed with <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſms,</hi> to make the Juvenile <hi>Academicks</hi> Merry, is the moſt Edifying diſcourſe to Better the World. I can remember ſince ſuch <hi>Athenian</hi> Entertainments were Tranſporting <hi>Muſick</hi> to my ſelf: which now I Abhor as the moſt harſh and grating <hi>Noiſes.</hi> And I cannot applaud that for the <hi>Beſt</hi> Sermon, which makes the worſt part of the Audience moſt <hi>Sport.</hi> May I be ſo happy to ſpeak to the Conſcience and Satisfaction of Serious and Experienced <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> And I am in little care to Tickle the wanton ears of <hi>Novices</hi> in Religion, and Scoffers at <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151193:4"/>
            <p>But ſo far as I have ſomewhere brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made bold to touch upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Divine,</hi> 'Tis not in the bitter <hi>Satyrical</hi> ſtrain, wherein he has of late thought fit to handle his learned <hi>Brother.</hi> Indeed, (as ſome are ſtartled to obſerve a new ſort of <hi>Calvinian</hi> Rigor, and ſuch boiſterous Blaſts from that Point, which has a Name for the Mildeſt Quarter, ſo) I cannot but Admire to ſee men ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deal their Blows, and let fly at others, for <hi>Inſufferable Inſolence both of Stile and Temper,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Animadv. p. 353.</note> crying out of them for <hi>Infinitely Scornful, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Spightful:</hi> Thus ſeeming to <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that Duty</hi> which (ſay they) <hi>every man owes both to Decency and himſelf, always obliging him to ſpeak only as becomes him, however Adverſaries provoke him.</hi> A good Rule, ſo apt to be forgotten, That he whom moſt tongues do praiſe for teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us the <hi>Governnment of the Tongue,</hi> complains <hi>It is a piece of Morality which ſober Nature dictates, and yet in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies many of our greateſt Scholars ſeem
<pb facs="tcp:151193:5"/>totally to have Unlearn't it: Managing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes in Religion with ſuch Virulence, that one would think the Diſputants had put off much of Humanity,
<note place="margin">Dec. Chriſt Pi. p. 279.</note> before they came thus to treat of Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor ſhould I have ſaid any thing at all wherein this <hi>Author</hi> might have thought himſelf concerned, had not I fear'd, his Reflections might Hurt others, more than mine are like to Damnify him. But being equally Engaged with him in the Common Cauſe of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> As far as I underſtand it, Wo to me if I do it not. And when I know that Goſpel to be no <hi>Servile Yoke,</hi> but a <hi>Law of Liberty:</hi> As ſuch therefore I do appear for it. And whoever cry out of a Gap opened to <hi>Licentiouſneſs,</hi> I think we ſhould be in as much care to Maintain the <hi>Liberty,</hi> as to prevent the <hi>Abuſe.</hi> Or elſe they who complain ſo much of the <hi>Prieſt-Riding,</hi> (however abuſively they are wont to apply it; Yet) may pick out
<pb facs="tcp:151193:5"/>matter for a juſt Charge, That we <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the word of God deceitfully,</hi> and <hi>Shun to declare to them all the Counſel of God:</hi> And like <hi>Lords over his beritage,</hi> and Harder Maſters than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> withhold from them what he has <hi>Granted</hi> them: And Tie them up, where he has ſet them <hi>Free.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be no Surprize to me, If I find the Reward ſo commonly beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch as write <hi>Irenicums,</hi> for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſting and Compounding Litigious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>i. e.</hi> To be pincht on both Sides. The <hi>Anteſignani</hi> that lead Contending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thô all to pieces in every thing elſe, yet can meet and hold together, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s <hi>Foxes,</hi> to carry <hi>Firebrands,</hi> and ſet the Fields all in a Flame. I know what the <hi>Moderate man</hi> uſes to be taken for, among ſuch furious Drivers: But I muſt beg their pardon, If I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take them for any of the beſt <hi>Judges.</hi> I had much rather be determined by our late moſt Reverend and Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Primate, (whoſe great Soul much diſdain'd the mean Service of our Squib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb facs="tcp:151193:6"/>
               <hi>Boutefeus,</hi> that fill the <hi>Church</hi> with endleſs Noiſe, and Heat, and pother, about the <hi>Mint, Anniſe</hi> and <hi>Cummin:</hi> But was for having all ſuch <hi>Bones</hi> Buried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his <hi>Own</hi>); and I cannot forbear to quote a Golden <hi>Paragraph,</hi> worthy of ſuch an Excellent <hi>Author,</hi> in his Preface to a Collection of Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> Sermons, vindicating the moſt deſerved Fame of that Right Reverend <hi>Prelate;</hi> ſays he, <hi>I purpoſely mention his Moderation, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe adventure to Commend him for it; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that this Vertue, ſo much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Magnified by Wiſe men, in all Ages, has of late been Declaim'd againſt with ſo much Zeal and Fierceneſs, and yet with that good Grace and Confidence, as if it were not only no Vertue, but even the Sum and abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Vices. I ſay, notwithſtanding this, I am ſtill of the old opinion, That Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is a Vertue, and one of the peculiar ornaments and advantages of the excellent Conſtitution of our Church, and muſt at laſt be the temper of her Members, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Clergy, if ever we ſeriouſly intend
<pb facs="tcp:151193:6"/>the firm Eſtabliſhment of this Church, and do not induſtriouſly deſign, by cheriſhing heats and diviſions among ourſelves, to let in Popery at thoſe Breaches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I break not in upon any thing that is <hi>Eſtabliſhed,</hi> nor confront whatever for <hi>Decency and Order</hi> is Appointed: being well ſatisfied, That I can be a <hi>Member</hi> and <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and yet the <hi>Lord's Free-man.</hi> Yea whenever I look towards <hi>Rome,</hi> I cannot but bleſs his Name, That by the <hi>Grace of God I am</hi> Where, and <hi>What I am.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I cannot think they are True to their <hi>Lord,</hi> nor Juſt to their <hi>Church,</hi> nor yet Kind to their <hi>Brethren,</hi> who would have men under their <hi>Girdle,</hi> where the Lord, and the Church both has left them at <hi>Liberty.</hi> What is ſo Graciouſly <hi>Given</hi> and <hi>Granted,</hi> I do Plead for, in behalf of every one that ought to Share in it. And if thou art contented with this, <hi>Reader,</hi> and craveſt no more, Take ſo much <hi>Liberty,</hi> without ſcruple, and much good may it do thee: And ſo <hi>Farewell.</hi>

                     <p>The ſame Light which ſhews us a <hi>God,</hi> teaches us alſo the Veneration of that <hi>Almighty Being</hi> which is ſo Superlatively Excellent. Pſal. 86.9, 10. <hi>All Nations whom thou haſt made ſhall come and worſhip before thee O Lord: And ſhall Glorify thy Name. For thou art Great, and doſt Wondrous things: Thou art God alone.</hi> No <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks</hi> that ever own'd any Deity, have denied <hi>Invocation:</hi> which is as the <hi>Bucket</hi> whereby we draw out of God's Infinite Fulneſs, to ſupply our wants. Even thoſe rude <hi>Seamen, Jon.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Cried every man to his God.</hi> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, Rom. 10.12. <hi>There is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Jew and the Greek, For the ſame Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Reaſonable Service</hi> which every Wiſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering man muſt needs chuſe and perform. Nor can we make any better Uſe of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> which God hath given us to <hi>Know</hi> Him: or of the <hi>Speech</hi> wherewith he hath endowed us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his <hi>Glory.</hi> Indeed our very <hi>Precarious Beings</hi> call us to <hi>Prayers:</hi> As all <hi>Weak</hi> things are taught by the <hi>Dictates</hi> of their own Nature, to make towards, and <hi>Lean</hi> upon, that which will Support them: The <hi>Hop,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> the <hi>Ivy,</hi> (that cannot ſtand Themſelves,) With their wires and Tendrils catch hold on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe to bear them up. So what ſhould poor <hi>Derivative</hi> Creatures but repair to the Almighty <hi>Giver,</hi> to be alſo the Continual <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver</hi> of their Being? When we feel our-ſelves ſtill verging to Nothing, And that we have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151193:10"/>no power to <hi>hold our Souls</hi> in Life one Moment: Whither ſhall we betake our ſelves, but to the <hi>Root</hi> of all Being for Support? And in the want of every thing, whither but to the <hi>Fountain of all Goodneſs,</hi> for Supply? We hang upon Him ſtill for our Being, and all the Comforts of it; who continues to Create us every moment. And Prayer is the Souls <hi>Flying back</hi> again to Him from whom it came: Who exacts our Devotions, as the Sun draws <hi>Vapours</hi> from the earth: Not to retain them for his own Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, but to rain them down in <hi>Showers</hi> of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon us. The <hi>Debt</hi> is owing to him, but the paying of it, only Advantageous to ourſelves: And in ſerving him, we ſerve our own beſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He commands indeed many things above the power of <hi>Nature,</hi> to bring us upon our Knees for his <hi>Grace,</hi> that where our ſtrength <hi>ends,</hi> there our Prayers may <hi>begin:</hi> And that we may Seek for that in Him, which we have not in ourſelves. And tho the infinitely <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> needs neither our Confeſſions, to <hi>Inform</hi> him of our Wants, Nor our Petitions to make him <hi>Inclinable</hi> to Relieve them: Yet he will be <hi>Enquired</hi> of by us, to do for us: And notwithſtanding He <hi>Blots out our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for his Own Sake:</hi> Yet he Calls on us to Call upon Him: And bids, <hi>Put me in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: Let us plead together: Declare thou, that thou maiſt be juſtified.</hi> Iſa. 43.25. and 6. And by this means we come to Bethink our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151193:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>From whence it is that we have all: That we may not impute to our <hi>Good Luck,</hi> what we owe to the <hi>Divine Bounty:</hi> Nor Undervalue the Favours of <hi>Heaven,</hi> coming ſo Lightly by them, without any <hi>Seeking.</hi> He will have us exerciſe our Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, our Dependance upon him, and our Affiance in him: So to <hi>Diſpoſe</hi> us for the the Reception and Fruition of what we would have from him. And therefore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to his <hi>Gates,</hi> that he may load us with his <hi>Bleſſings:</hi> And commands us to <hi>Ask,</hi> and <hi>Seek,</hi> and <hi>Knock,</hi> That we may receive, and <hi>Find,</hi> and <hi>Enjoy.</hi> This <hi>Key</hi> the Gracious God is pleas'd to put into our Hands, That we may go to all the inexhauſtible <hi>Treaſures</hi> of his Bounty, even as we go to our Table for Meat. That we who are ſo <hi>Indigent</hi> and Beggarly, may be throwly furniſhed with Him, who is <hi>Able to do exceeding abundantly, even above all that we ask or think.</hi> And O how well is it for us! And what riches of Grace from the Lord of Love, That the Gates of Heaven ſhall be open'd at our Knocking: That a Supply ſhall be Granted for our Asking: And that our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Seeking ſhall be rewarded with Finding Eternal Glory! O how would the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> be thronged, if their Gates and Hearts and Hands were ſo Open to all Comers? If it were no more, but <hi>Come</hi> and <hi>Ask</hi> and <hi>Have?</hi>

                     <p>It is not more needful for a Creature to live in <hi>Dependance</hi> on his Maker and Preſerver, But it is as full of ſweet Satisfaction, for poor frail <hi>Inſufficient</hi> wretches, who Want every thing, and lye open here ſtill to all Changes and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Dangers, To have an All-ſufficient Helper, and the ſafeſt Sanctuary to Repair to, and Solace our ſelves in. O what ſhould we do, and whither Betake our ſelves, if we had not this Happy <hi>Retreat</hi> to turn in at? If left Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to ſhift for our ſelves, and make us a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or want it? O Kind word then from a Good God, <hi>Come unto me,</hi> and <hi>Call upon me.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, Unload your heavy Hearts with me, And <hi>Caſt your Care upon me:</hi> Make known your Requeſts to me, and put the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into my Hands; And I will take Care of you, and Provide for you. O the eaſy Acceſs that a poor ſoul has to the Throne of Grace! Where (as the good Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> ſpeaks,) it is not <hi>Death to draw nigh, before the Golden Scepter be extended.</hi> No Time out of ſeaſon, No Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo inconſiderable, No Words ſo ordinary, no Boon ſo big, No Grant ſo hard, as to give the hearty Supplication a Repulſe, But riſing like a thin <hi>Miſt</hi> from the earth, it returns in a plentiful <hi>Rain</hi> of manifold Bleſſings.</p>
                     <p>Our kind <hi>Redeemer</hi> chides us that we make no more uſe of this ſweet and bleſſed Advantage. Joh. 16.24. <hi>Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my Name; Ask and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full.</hi> And how well do we deſerve to go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151193:12"/>that, which we count not worth ſo much as the <hi>Asking</hi> for? O that we ſhould be ſo <hi>Liſtleſs</hi> to do our ſelves Good, when the <hi>God of all Grace</hi> is ſo Willing to be Kind? As it was ſaid of the Emperor <hi>Severus, (Moleſtius erat illi nihil peti, quàm dare,)</hi> It troubled him more to be Asked nothing, than to give much. And to the Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that made not bold with him, he would ſay, <hi>(Quid eſt quod nihil petis?)</hi> What's the matter, thou askeſt no Boon of me? Let me know what thou wouldſt have, that thou maiſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, Thou art never the better for me.

                     </p>
                     <p>We are indeed <hi>Bound</hi> to it: But yet we muſt make a <hi>Free will offering</hi> of it, and be <hi>Volunteers</hi> at our Prayers. For if it be a <hi>Forced-put,</hi> it is not Religion. <hi>Beaſts</hi> might, but <hi>Men</hi> muſt not, be <hi>Dragg'd</hi> to God's Altar: nor be <hi>Threatned</hi> with Happineſs, nor <hi>Clubb'd</hi> into Heaven.

                     <head>CHAP. I. <hi>The Liberty of Praying, as to the</hi> Matter.</head>
                     <p>FOR the <hi>Matter</hi> of Prayer, or the <hi>Petenda</hi> which we may put on for: There is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Large Grant, and as much <hi>Scope</hi> given as any one can tell how to wiſh. Mat. 21.22. <hi>All things whatſoever ye ſhall ask in Prayer, Believing, ye ſhall receive.</hi> It leaves out nothing Deſirable, that a man can <hi>Need,</hi> or has the Boldneſs to <hi>Crave.</hi> But yet when words are too Wide for the <hi>Matter,</hi> they muſt be Limited according to the <hi>Mind</hi> of the Author. Which Rule is here to take place; For who can imagine that our <hi>Lord</hi> would put us upon Praying for things <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful?</hi> things that would <hi>Diſhonor</hi> him to Grant, and <hi>Ruin</hi> us to Have? which yet would be comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>All things whatſoever,</hi> taken without any <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation.</hi> Who can imagine, That he ſhould ever countenance the <hi>Wanton</hi> Praying for Health to fulfil his <hi>Luſts?</hi> Or the <hi>Malicious</hi> for opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to execute his <hi>Rage?</hi> Or the <hi>Ambitious</hi> for High places to gratify his <hi>Pride?</hi> Or the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous</hi> Praying for the Death of all that ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and an <hi>Eſtate?</hi> Or the <hi>High-way man</hi> forrich Booty, and Succeſs in his adventures and <hi>Villany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Men may be aſhamed to make their Tongues the <hi>Index</hi> of their Minds, as to ſuch <hi>Extravagant</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="tcp:151193:13"/>Deſires, which yet notwithſtanding may find harbor in their Hearts. But theſe wild and wicked Requeſts, be ſure, are none of the Petitions which our <hi>Holy Saviour</hi> emboldens us to offer. The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> that is very free of what is none of his own, will promiſe without Exception, as he did to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>All theſe things will I give thee.</hi> But by our Lord's <hi>All,</hi> we muſt never underſtand any more than is <hi>Lawful</hi> and <hi>convenient:</hi> What is Fit for us to Ask, And what he has promiſed to <hi>Beſtow:</hi> i. e. <hi>The Kingdom of God, and his Righteouſneſs:</hi> With the addition of ſuch World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Appendages,</hi> as his Wiſdom knows proper and Good for us. Spiritual accompliſhments, and Temporal Advantages too: Even all needful to bring us to <hi>Heaven:</hi> And, till we reach thither, to <hi>Support</hi> us on Earth. But we muſt not offer <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable</hi> Requeſts, To have all that a roving Fancy can tower up: Or for <hi>Impoſſible</hi> things, That God ſhould <hi>falſify</hi> his Word, to ſave us <hi>without Holineſs:</hi> Nor put him upon the expence of <hi>Miracles,</hi> to make us on a ſuddain, The moſt Learned or Great in the world: Nor <hi>Limit the Holy One</hi> to juſt the particulars of our naming: As the mother of <hi>Zebedee</hi>'s children, <hi>That the one might ſit on the Right, and the other on the Left Hand, in his Kingdom:</hi> Nor <hi>Tempt the Lord our God,</hi> to <hi>turn Stones into Bread,</hi> Asking to be fed in our Sloth, and careleſneſs to help our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>All things</hi> we have Liberty to ask, That make for the <hi>Glory</hi> of our Lord, and for our own real <hi>Good</hi> here, and our Eternal <hi>Salvation</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151193:14"/>Indeed what he would have us Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune our Father which is in Heaven for, He hath given us a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of, in that beſt <hi>Platform</hi> of Prayer, by which all ours are to be Modelled: <hi>i. e.</hi> To mind firſt the <hi>Glorifying</hi> and <hi>Pleaſing</hi> of God, And then the Serving of our own turns. The Bleſſings of Wiſdom's <hi>Right Hand,</hi> Such as the Pardon of ſin, the Knowledge of our Lord's Will, the Graces of God's Spirit, and Eternal Life, We are to pray for Urgently and <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> Becauſe the things cannot chuſe but prove for our <hi>Good:</hi> And we cannot Glorify God, and do Well without them. Light and Grace, and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, and the <hi>Spirit of Supplication,</hi> we muſt ſeek before Gifts, and Peace, and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: Becauſe we may go <hi>Weak and Troubled</hi> to Heaven: But if we know not <hi>God's ways</hi> we ſhall not <hi>Enter into his Reſt:</hi> And <hi>without Holineſs no ſeeing the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then the <hi>World's Good,</hi> and what concerns our preſent <hi>Well-being</hi> in it, As Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Health and Eaſe, Deliverance and Quiet, Fruitful ſeaſons, and Proſperous circumſtances, We may pray for too; and not count it <hi>Carnal</hi> to Seek after even thoſe things which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> do; When our Heavenly Father, not only knows we have <hi>Need of them,</hi> but alſo by his Command, makes it our Duty to <hi>Ask</hi> them: And by his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> gives us Encouragement to Ask in Hopes of Receiving them. We may Beg ſo much of the <hi>World's Good,</hi> as will really do us <hi>Good:</hi> Yea and deſire what ſhall <hi>Comfort,</hi> as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151193:14"/>well as <hi>Support</hi> us: In caſe it do not Hinder, but Promote, our <hi>Duty.</hi> Tho' we dread the Beſt things of this World, for our <hi>Portion,</hi> Yet even theſe temporal Fruitions are deſirable, on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, That we may thereby <hi>Honour</hi> our Lord, and Secure our <hi>Salvation.</hi> For we are not ſure, that thoſe <hi>Means</hi> will effectually promote theſe <hi>Ends.</hi> God knows whether we ſhall be <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> in a Rich, Healthy, Proſperous, Or in a Poor, Sick, and Troubled ſtate. He is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Kindeſt to us, In <hi>Denying</hi> us what we are Eagereſt upon. <hi>The Chuſing of our Inheritance for us</hi> then, we had beſt Refer to Him: And be well pleaſed to be at his <hi>Finding,</hi> however he is pleaſed to uſe us.</p>
                     <p>But yet in the <hi>Conditional</hi> Petition even for Temporal things, we are not ſo Tied up, as to ask what comes to <hi>Nothing</hi> at all, and leave the matter juſt as we found it. There is more Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty here, than for the <hi>Sick</hi> man to pray as much for the Continuance or Increaſe of his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,</hi> as to have it Mitigated or Removed. The Requeſt may be <hi>Abſolute,</hi> only attended with a ſignified or a Silent <hi>Submiſſion</hi> to the wiſe and good Diſpoſal of the great <hi>Lord</hi> of all, tho' he ſhould determine otherwiſe. We may heartily <hi>Deſire</hi> the thing: But yet not be ſo <hi>Set</hi> upon it, as to deſire it in any Caſe, Tho' God ſhould be <hi>Offended,</hi> or our Souls <hi>Damnified,</hi> if not Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by it. We may deſire <hi>Honor,</hi> the better to ſerve the Publick Good: And <hi>Wealth,</hi> more to <hi>Honor the Lord,</hi> and Cheriſh the Poor, with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:151193:15"/>our <hi>Subſtance:</hi> And <hi>Health,</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> and <hi>Length of Days,</hi> That we may be more <hi>Servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> in our generation, and bring greater Glory to our Heavenly Father. Provided ſtill, we humbly <hi>Beſign</hi> our Wills to His, and take it Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, Tho' we be Croſs'd, and fail of our Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes: Yea perſwading our ſelves, then, It is <hi>Beſt</hi> for us, that ſo it ſhould be. The <hi>World's</hi> good things we muſt deſire but <hi>Sparingly,</hi> As not being ſure but they may Succeed no better to us, than the <hi>Quails</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to make us the Worſe for them. But <hi>Covet earneſtly the Beſt Gifts,</hi> thoſe Holy qualifications, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Bleſſings that <hi>Accompany Salvation,</hi> which will certainly do us Good, and make us Happy. Whether we come in, or be left out of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of ſuch <hi>Common Favours,</hi> as God, with an <hi>Indifferent</hi> hand, ſcatters among all ſorts of men, That we may be <hi>Remembred with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which He bears to his People, and Viſited with the Joy of his Salvation.</hi> Little need have we to mind the <hi>Stuff</hi> here, when all the Good of the <hi>Promiſed Land</hi> is before us. And how well may that be called <hi>All,</hi> which takes in whatever the Largeſt Soul of man can wiſh?</p>

                        <l>We cannot ask the thing that is not there,</l>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151193:15"/>Let us not then be <hi>Streightned</hi> in our Prayers, when we have ſo much <hi>Liberty</hi> given us: And we cannot <hi>Open our mouths</hi> ſo wide, but He whoſe <hi>Gift is Eternal Life,</hi> has promiſed to <hi>Fill them:</hi> And to pleaſure us not only to the <hi>Half,</hi> but even the <hi>Whole</hi> of his Kingdom. And what more can we Ask or think, than <hi>All Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Glory everlaſting,</hi> with whatever is <hi>Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> Here, to bring us Safe thither?</p>
                     <p>Poor Chriſtian, who art Humble and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, <hi>Trembling at Gods Word,</hi> Be not Modeſt in thy own <hi>Wrong:</hi> When thou art allowed to Enlarge thy Deſires as wide as to what's <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite:</hi> Loſe it not for want of <hi>Asking.</hi> Thou mayſt think a <hi>Crown and Kingdom,</hi> moſt Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and never failing, too <hi>Good</hi> for thee, a Sinful wretch, to expect: But they are not too <hi>Great</hi> for the God <hi>Infinitely Good,</hi> to Beſtow. This is the drift of all thy Prayers: No leſs thou art to beg, than <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and with him <hi>All things:</hi> In this world, the Knowledge, and Love, and Obedience of Gods <hi>Truth,</hi> and in the world to come, <hi>Life everlaſting.</hi> And that End of thy Faith, <hi>The Salvation of thy Soul,</hi> as it muſt be the <hi>Aim,</hi> ſo it will be the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of thy Prayers. For <hi>whoſoever ſhall Call on the Name of the Lord ſhall be Saved.</hi> Rom. 10.13. Do but Ask as thou ſhould'ſt, and thou ſhalt Have what thou Wilt.</p>

And ſo I may uſe ſuch words, as I find fitteſt to Enflame my affections, that I may ſtand rightly diſpoſed to receive his Mercies. Whether I pray in a <hi>Book,</hi> or without, is the ſmalleſt matter to Him: So that I Pray at all <hi>indeed,</hi> And when I uſe the Book, am not <hi>Lazy</hi> and <hi>Formal,</hi> And when I uſe none, am not <hi>Rude</hi> and <hi>Proud,</hi> but ſtill <hi>Humble</hi> and <hi>Hearty.</hi> To <hi>Pray,</hi> is a great deal more than <hi>Saying</hi> of Prayers.

                        </p>
                        <p>Now tho it is not for the <hi>Weak</hi> to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon Services above their <hi>Strength,</hi> Yet it looks ill, when men are <hi>Fluent</hi> on other Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and only <hi>Tongue-ty'd</hi> at their Prayers: When they paſs for <hi>good Speakers</hi> every where elſe, but are <hi>Down in the mouth</hi> at the Throne of Grace. This ſpeaks a Defect that is ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to be not only their <hi>Calamity,</hi> but their <hi>Impiety.</hi> Indeed the very Senſe of Want and Pain, where prevalent, will open the Mouths not otherwiſe Eloquent, and ſometimes ſuggeſt and dictate things above their common Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As a <hi>Malefactor,</hi> tho no Orator, yet when Begging for his Life, will find <hi>Words</hi> Significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Moving. However many may often need the aſſiſtance of <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Forms:</hi> And whoever find their caſe better Expreſt by others, than they know how to do it themſelves, have
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151193:47"/>their <hi>Liberty</hi> ſo to help themſelves: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Scrupling to uſe Others words, may <hi>Thank God</hi> for that <hi>Advantage,</hi> to warm their Hearts, and raiſe their Affections, and Enflame their Devotions.</p>
                        <p>It makes my Prayer neither better nor worſe, whether my Eyes take words off the <hi>Paper</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me: Or whether by recollection, I fetch them out of my <hi>Memory,</hi> which is (as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop calls it,) but a kind of <hi>Inviſible Book.</hi>

Tho <hi>Old</hi> words, it's true, may be uſed with <hi>New Affections,</hi> and ſerve as well where the caſe is the ſame: Yet there are ſome New <hi>Occaſions</hi> of my Life that call for a <hi>New Song.</hi> And where the Expreſſions as well as Affections are <hi>New,</hi> and the beſt that we can fetch out of our <hi>Treaſure,</hi> It ſpeaks the <hi>Value</hi> which we put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>Benefactors</hi> favours, That we prize them more than to mention them ſtill in the ordinary <hi>Rote.</hi> We count it not only Flat and <hi>Dilute,</hi> but Contemptuous and <hi>Slighting,</hi> to ſpeak after that Manner, to our great <hi>Friends</hi> on earth; How much more concern'd ſhould we be to Appear before the <hi>Greateſt</hi> and <hi>Beſt</hi> of all which is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> with ſomewhat to expreſs our higheſt <hi>Regard</hi> of Him and his Bleſſings, and alſo our moſt <hi>Careful Hearts</hi> to approve our ſelves <hi>Senſible</hi> and duly <hi>Affected?</hi> Of which our Speech is the <hi>Indication:</hi> And ſo that we Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our ſelves <hi>to the purpoſe,</hi> it matters not whether the words be <hi>our own,</hi> or <hi>Borrowed,</hi> from one or another: We may <hi>Preſs</hi> them into this Service wherever we find them.

                        <p>THE uſual Method of Prayer is <hi>Confeſſion, Petition,</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving.</hi> Yet we are not in every Prayer, tied up juſt to this <hi>Order.</hi> We may ſometimes omit one of the Parts, or put the Laſt Firſt, or only <hi>Beg,</hi> without Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite <hi>Confeſſing</hi> our Sins, or <hi>Bleſſing</hi> the Lord. Tho we are Bound to all theſe things, yet not at all <hi>Times</hi> that we make our Prayers. We may Inſiſt but upon one Point, and yet not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:151193:49"/>Maim or Mangle our Devotions: According as we are particularly <hi>Diſpoſed</hi> in our Minds, or preſt with any particular <hi>Occaſions</hi> in our Lives. That which at this <hi>Time,</hi> we find we have moſt <hi>Need</hi> to do, or are fitteſt for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, To do it Heartily will ſuffice, and find Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, Tho every thing be not mentioned that belongs to a <hi>Full Prayer.</hi> It is not a Guilt at which we need to Deject our ſelves, for Curtailing and <hi>Diſmembring</hi> our Offices, When we leave out ſome <hi>Part,</hi> and are Intent upon another, in which we think our ſelves <hi>Now</hi> more immediately Concerned. 'Tis well, and indeed a great Attainment, in which we may Hug our ſelves, If we can diſpatch but any one Part, with ſerious and fervent Devotion. Tho the <hi>Enumeration</hi> and Confeſſion of our Sins, with Confuſion of face and <hi>Compunction</hi> of heart, to Humble us before the Lord, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us for his Pardon and Grace, is of the greateſt uſe for poor <hi>Obnoxious</hi> Sinful Creatures: Yet in our Lord's own <hi>Form</hi> there is no <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> but only what is <hi>Tacit</hi> and <hi>Implicite:</hi> As where in asking for <hi>Daily Bread,</hi> we acknowledge our Wants and Indigence: In begging <hi>Forgiveneſs of our Treſpaſſes,</hi> we acknowledge our Guilt and Wickedneſs: And in Praying not to be <hi>Lead into Temptation,</hi> we acknowledge our Weakneſs, and how prone we are of our ſelves, to go all to Naught: And alſo that we <hi>Deſerve</hi> the Puniſhment, which we Pray to be <hi>Delivered from.</hi> So that altho we ſhould be us'd and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:151193:49"/>forward to <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> Yet we muſt not Entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle our <hi>Conſciences</hi> with a Conceit of the <hi>Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> lying upon us, expreſly to Confeſs our Sins in every Prayer: Nor yet the Neceſſity of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Reciting the Mercies and Favours which we have received at the hands of God. Tho Thankfulneſs (which is our good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners towards Heaven) as much becomes his <hi>Obliged,</hi> as Confeſſion (which is a Self Arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to clear our Judge,) becomes his <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders:</hi> Yet there may be the <hi>Broken</hi> and the <hi>Grateful</hi> heart, ſenſible both of Sin and Mercy, without the particular Naming, either our Sins, or God's Benefits.</p>
                        <p>However 'tis my own Senſe, and my deſire to make all I can alike minded, That it not only Becomes, but <hi>Behoves</hi> us to be Thankful: which being a Tribute we owe to the Crown of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> I count it no better than <hi>Wrong</hi> and <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery</hi> to withhold it. Nay ſo Material a point is this, That ſome (I think, not amiſs) have ſumm'd up the whole of our Religion in the one Word, <hi>Gratitude:</hi> To be ſenſible of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits from Above, and all our Obligations to the Lord, and ſtill Acknowledging the Debt, which we are never Able to Pay: Full of Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>What we ſhall render to the Lord for all his Benefits;</hi> And where the Poverty of our caſe checks all thoughts of Retaliation, yet giving unto God, at leaſt, the <hi>Glory</hi> of his own Gifts: Yea for the due Expreſſion of this Gratitude, Loving and Honouring, and Praiſing our great

                           <hi>Benefactor;</hi> Truſting and Delighting in him, Afraid to Offend and Loſe him, and ſtudying and ſtriving in all things, to Pleaſe him. And as it is our <hi>Reaſonahle Service,</hi> and the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous Diſpoſition of Soul, (as well as the ſweeteſt Solace of our Lives, The <hi>Marrow and Fatneſs</hi> of our Religion, and the joyful Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of Bleſſed Spirits above,) thus to Obſerve and Recount, to Particularize and Magnify the Favours of Heaven to us; So 'tis the moſt Decent Begging of what is yet Wanting: and our prudential Gaining upon the <hi>Goodneſs of God,</hi> to run on ſtill in the ſame Channel: Seeing he accounts his Benefits there beſt placed, where they are moſt Gratefully Reſented. This then we muſt be in care not to leave Undone: And yet I dare not ſay that we are bound to do it <hi>(toties quoties)</hi> every time we Pray.</p>
                        <p>So tho it looks moſt proper for the Guilty and <hi>Conſcious,</hi> to go upon their Submiſſion to the Holy Majeſty offended, and before they <hi>Ask,</hi> to Acknowledge how unworthy they are to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive:</hi> and make their Confeſſions the <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> to their Prayers: Yet a Great man, well vers'd in theſe matters, The Right Reverend Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> (in an Epiſtle concerning the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual exerciſe of a Chriſtian to Keep his heart,)</hi> gives this Advice, To begin our Prayers with the <hi>Praiſes of God,</hi> Taking notice of all his Goodneſs to us, and the great things which ſtill he has done for us, and the continued Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:151193:50"/>with which he goes on to Oblige us. To be <hi>in Thankſgiving firſt, and then in Requeſts.</hi> And to Bethink our ſelves, How Unworthy we have walk'd of ſuch Mercy, and to recount our Abuſes of his Kindneſs and Love, may prove an effectual Method to <hi>Melt</hi> and Diſſolve our hard and ſtony Hearts: That laying to heart, how Good he has been to us, and how wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly we have Misbehav'd our ſelves, and carried moſt ill to the <hi>Beſt</hi> of <hi>Fathers, The Goodneſs of God may lead us to Repentance.</hi> Now they that, upon trial, find the <hi>Benefit</hi> of this courſe, are <hi>Free,</hi> to take it. And I ſhall not think it <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous</hi> in my Prayers, To deliver my ſelf <hi>Firſt</hi> of that which lies moſt upon my <hi>opirit,</hi> and chiefly Affects my Heart, whatever it be; Good things to be Begged: Or Sins or Mercies to be Acknowledged: I take it for a <hi>Direction</hi> and <hi>Call,</hi> to <hi>Begin</hi> with that which I am ſo <hi>Full</hi> of, and in Pain till I have poured it out; However it may ſeem to <hi>Invert</hi> the common Order.</p>
                        <p>And if you make uſe of <hi>Another</hi>'s Form, You muſt not think your ſelves obliged to every Word, and to take <hi>All before you:</hi> But may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or add, or leave out, as Diſeretion ſhall ſuggeſt, or you Judge fitteſt for your purpoſe. They that are Converſant with God have a <hi>Taſte</hi> for Spiritual things, as well as for their common <hi>Food,</hi> To Diſtinguiſh between better and worſe. And then they are not Bound to take all that they find, and to ſwallow that which they do not <hi>Like:</hi> But may pick out of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:151193:51"/>the <hi>Book,</hi> all one as at the <hi>Table,</hi> what is <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> and let the reſt alone; and make it up with what they find moſt Grateful to them, and Beneficial for them.</p>
                        <p>Yea he that is to be the <hi>Speaker,</hi> in Praying with others, may <hi>Change</hi> his Prayers, according to the Company, without being a ſinful <hi>Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver,</hi> or <hi>Man-pleaſer.</hi> Tho it is the ſame <hi>God</hi> I ſpeak to every where, Yet the Wants and Humours of men are ſo exceeding <hi>Different,</hi> that what moſt <hi>Takes</hi> with ſome is as much <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted</hi> by others.

However ſome may be Offended at that which is not really <hi>Offenſive,</hi> Yet if I know it to be <hi>Diſtaſtful,</hi> I would not offer it, if I could well avoid it, I would not <hi>Obtrude</hi> upon them the Food of their Souls ſo <hi>Cook'd,</hi> as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>Abide</hi> it, But give them the ſame thing, in another <hi>Vehicle</hi> and <hi>Preparation.</hi> And that not to be applauded by them, or to <hi>Ingratiate</hi> my ſelf with them: But to be moſt Uſeful to them, and beſt to ſerve the <hi>Ends</hi> of Religion upon
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:151193:51"/>them. And upon this account, I ſcruple not, ſometimes, to <hi>Vary</hi> my Prayers, according to the <hi>Genius</hi> and Inclination of the <hi>Company</hi> with whom I am to Pray. For two Companies may be both of them Pious and well diſpos'd, And yet the one all for that <hi>Way</hi> which the other is as much <hi>Againſt.</hi> And I have no Scruple of Conſcience againſt <hi>either way.</hi> If then I would not <hi>Offend</hi> but <hi>Edify</hi> them, I muſt take the way which I perceive to be moſt <hi>Agreeable.</hi> That they may heartily <hi>Concur</hi> with me, and that my Prayers may not be an Exerciſe of their <hi>Patience,</hi> but of their <hi>Devotion.</hi>

And we have many other things to do beſides Praying. Therefore it muſt be <hi>ſoftened</hi> ſo as to require of us only what we can well perform. And that is, To keep our ſelves ſtill in a <hi>Frame</hi> and diſpoſition for Prayer, that we may be <hi>Ready,</hi> upon all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to fall into it. For as Bp. <hi>Hall</hi> inſtructs us, [Devout Soul, p. 10.] <hi>Devotion is not only an Act of Vocal Prayer, But the Habitual diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a holy Soul ſweetly converſing with God, in all the Forms of a heavenly (yet awful) Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, and a Conſtant entertainment of ourſelves here below with the God of Spirits in our ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified thoughts and affections.</hi> 'Tis true, The
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:151193:53"/>Sacrifice muſt not be evermore <hi>Actually</hi> in the offering, But the Fire of Devotion ever <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> on the <hi>Altar</hi> of the heart. And no day muſt we Intermit our <hi>Times</hi> of Praying, but go on in a <hi>Courſe</hi> of Prayer, without Fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: and let its Returns be as Conſtant as our <hi>Meals.</hi> And as after our Dinner, we have done Eating for that <hi>Time:</hi> But ſhould we Ceaſe to <hi>Eat,</hi> we muſt Ceaſe to <hi>Live:</hi> So Prayer being a part of our Spiritual Suſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, we are every day to make our <hi>Meals</hi> of it, but never have done with it, till we have no <hi>Sins</hi> to be Pardoned, No <hi>Wants</hi> to be ſupplied, That is, till we have attained to ſuch Perſection, as is not in this Life <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable.</hi> We muſt not Give over, thô we have not ſtraight every thing that we Ask. But keep our ſuits on the File, <hi>Depending</hi> at the Throne of Grace. And as ſome Denial and drawing back, does but <hi>Whet</hi> the importunate Suiters Requeſt. So if the Lord ſeems ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to <hi>Caſt us away in Diſpleaſure,</hi> Yet we muſt take no Denial, nor be <hi>Weary of well-doing:</hi> But renew and <hi>Double</hi> our Requeſts; For <hi>in Due time we ſhall reap, if we Faint not.</hi> Still we muſt Examine ourſelves for the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> and ſtrive to Amend the matter in the next Prayer. And then we may take eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Second</hi> Prayer, for an anſwer to the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi> and conclude, That he who gives us the Grace to <hi>Perſiſt, Favours</hi> our Cauſe. Yea the very <hi>Perſeverance</hi> which he gives,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:151193:54"/>may be <hi>Better</hi> than the thing which we asked.</p>
                        <p>Uſe the <hi>Liberty</hi> granted then, and go on to Pray in Hopes to <hi>Speed.</hi> Seek <hi>every day,</hi> That you may not be ſadly to <hi>Seek</hi> at your <hi>Laſt day.</hi> Some have more <hi>Leiſure,</hi> and they ſhould be <hi>much</hi> in Prayer. And the men of <hi>Buſineſs</hi> ought to Pray for the Succeſs, and <hi>Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> too, of their Buſineſs. But whoever Fears and Loves God, will find Time to Wait upon him <hi>Every Day,</hi> whatever <hi>Stands</hi> the while. In the <hi>Morning</hi> we are Expoſed to the wide World, and have need to put ourſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Divine Conduct.</hi> And at <hi>Night,</hi> we are as in the <hi>Suburbs</hi> of Death, And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before we lie Down, it concerns us to <hi>Even</hi> matters with Heaven, leſt we Riſe not till it be in <hi>Another World.</hi> Much of a Chriſtian's buſineſs lies on his <hi>Knees.</hi> Let us be <hi>Much in Prayer,</hi> while we have Time, And when all our Time is gone, We ſhall have an <hi>Eternity,</hi> to be ever <hi>Praiſing the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>OUR Bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> in the firſt Word of his <hi>Prayer,</hi> teacheth us to Pray in <hi>Love,</hi> as well as in <hi>Faith:</hi> and to take in <hi>Others</hi> together with ourſelves. And here we are to go as <hi>Wide,</hi> as before. None is Debarred from <hi>Praying.</hi> And we muſt Leave out None, in our <hi>Prayers.</hi> If we do not ſtill <hi>Name,</hi> yet we muſt <hi>Intend</hi> them: And <hi>Make Prayers and Interceſſions for All men.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. Not only men of all <hi>Orders</hi> and Sorts, but <hi>All</hi> the men of every order and ſort. Our Charity ſhould be as <hi>Extenſive,</hi> even as the whole Race of <hi>Mankind.</hi> Like <hi>Fellow-Members</hi> of the ſame Body, Every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſhould have the ſame care one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>We are not indeed to Pray for the <hi>Dead,</hi> whoſe <hi>Parts</hi> are done, and their <hi>Final</hi> Condition already <hi>Determined.</hi> And it is equally idle and Impertinent, to Pray for that which <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready is,</hi> and that which <hi>Never ſhall be.</hi> That is, the Bliſs of thoſe that are <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> Or the Salvation of thoſe that are <hi>Loſt.</hi> Yet O how many
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151193:66"/>ſenſeleſs <hi>Maſſes</hi> are poured out upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and ſpilt in the Air? (Only that the Loſs is not great, unleſs the <hi>Stuffe</hi> were more Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:) by that <hi>Church</hi> which ſeems to have a great deal of <hi>Leiſure,</hi> and little to do, To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſo much Time, in Seeking <hi>to Reverſe</hi> what God hath already <hi>Concluded.</hi> But tho the <hi>Dead</hi> can receive no manner of Advantage from it, Yet (like ſome other Points of <hi>Popery</hi>) 'Tis too Gainful to the <hi>Living,</hi> eaſily to part with it. The Friends <hi>Departed</hi> Souls can have no Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it; but the Prieſts Living <hi>Bodies</hi> feel the Comfort. And where the <hi>Pay</hi> is ſo Good, they are not agrieved to ſpend ſo much Breath in thoſe kind of Prayers, that return in ſuch <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Showers,</hi> into their own Boſoms. And ſo it is indeed a Praying for <hi>Themſelves,</hi> tho called Praying for <hi>Others.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for the Salvation of all Men <hi>Living,</hi> we may Pray, becauſe we are not ſure but that all <hi>Now Living</hi> may be ſaved. They are <hi>Probatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and <hi>Paſſengers,</hi> upon their <hi>Tryal,</hi> and in the <hi>Way: Candidates</hi> of Happineſs, and Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it: And as far as ever any are now from it, we do not know but before they Dye, they may be brought into a Capacity of it, and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> to it. And the bare <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of the thing is Ground enough for our Prayers: Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Effects of our Chriſtian <hi>Love,</hi> and Charitable <hi>Deſires,</hi> We ſhall be the <hi>Better</hi> for theſe Prayers, tho every one whom we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in them, is not.</p>

                     <p>And this we may look upon as a good <hi>Omen,</hi> and happy <hi>Preſage</hi> of Reformation dawning, and a Bleſſed <hi>Day</hi> ready to break upon the <hi>Church,</hi> when Gods <hi>Remembrancers</hi> are Inſtant in Prayer, and Urgent, and Importunate with him for the <hi>Transfuſing</hi> of a <hi>New Life</hi> into the <hi>Dead Bones,</hi> and Recovering Decayed Piety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a more Healthy, Hearty, and Flouriſhing condition. And how far ſoever things are gone, and how little Hope ſoever ſeems to remain of <hi>Retrieving</hi> them, Yet it is not in Vain, but to very good Senſe, to <hi>Remonſtrate,</hi> and offer the Matter to Him, who <hi>Quickens the Dead, and calleth thoſe things that are not, as if they were.</hi> And who is pleas'd to make our Prayers the very <hi>Condition</hi> of his doing ſuch great things for his <hi>Church.</hi> How few ſoever then we have with us here, and how Improbable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be thought ever to ſee the <hi>Deformed</hi> Face of this Ungodly World changed into the <hi>Beauties of Holineſs,</hi> Yet let us not be out of Heart, to Ask of Him, to whom <hi>All things are Poſſible; Ariſe, O God, Plead thy own Cauſe.</hi> That if all be not fully Accompliſhed ſtrait to our wiſhes, we may have, at leaſt, the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſeeing ſome Preparation and <hi>Tendencies</hi> towards the Long'd for <hi>Revolution;</hi> And the preſent evil World <hi>Amended,</hi> and Gods Truth and Holineſs getting <hi>Ground</hi> in it. And in this Praying, we may take Encouragement, and go on in Hope of <hi>Prevailing;</hi> becauſe it is for the thing which God himſelf Loves and Favours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:151193:67"/>all, even His <hi>Holineſs</hi> and his <hi>Honour.</hi> Such are the Requeſts he looks moſt Graciouſly upon, and gives the beſt <hi>Welcome</hi> to them that come to his <hi>Gates</hi> upon this Errand; Not to crave the Pleaſures of the Fleſh, or the Greatneſs and Fullneſs of the World, But to beg <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and to <hi>Seek his Kingdom and the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs thereof.</hi> When his Glory is next our Hearts, and we are not concerned only <hi>To ſerve a Turn,</hi> Or to ſave our <hi>Stake,</hi> or ſet up our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> or <hi>Party</hi> in the World. But that the <hi>Name</hi> of God may not be Blaſphemed, nor his <hi>Holy Cauſe</hi> ſuffer, by the ungodly Oppoſers of it prevailing: That they may not be <hi>Fluſht</hi> with Succeſſes, to make them conclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the <hi>Right:</hi> Nor be let alone to Exalt themſelves, and Ruine thoſe, to whom the World is moſt <hi>Beholden,</hi> for its Continuance: Nor have cauſe to ſay, They have <hi>Prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods People.</hi> And tho we are ſo Unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, we cannot hope to be Heard upon our own Account, Yet may we Pray in Faith and comfortable Expectation, That God will do the thing for his <hi>Name's Sake,</hi> which he has no reaſon to do for <hi>our Sakes.</hi> When it is no other Cauſe but his <hi>Own,</hi> which we commend to his <hi>Care:</hi> That the <hi>Cauſe</hi> may not be ſpoiled for us <hi>Sinners:</hi> but that we <hi>Sinners</hi> may rather be <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> and <hi>Preſerved,</hi> becauſe we Profeſs the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Truth,</hi> and ſtand up for <hi>Pure Religion, and undefiled,</hi> and <hi>Proteſt</hi> againſt the <hi>Idolatries</hi> and <hi>Tyrannies,</hi> and <hi>Superſtitions,</hi> and <hi>Abominations,</hi>

How long ſhall the Wicked Triumph, and the Adverſary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? What wilt thou do unto thy great Name?

                     <p>Thus <hi>Large Souls</hi> go big with the Care of all the <hi>Churches;</hi> Yea take in them that are <hi>Without</hi> too, and ſo help to <hi>Bear up the Pillars</hi> of the earth.

Thus he Sayls and <hi>Trafficks</hi> for the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> not only to the Ends of the Earth, but quite up to the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;</hi> And comes back fraught with the rich <hi>Merchandize</hi> of all Bleſſings from Above; to make all that dwell on this Mighty <hi>Ball,</hi> Gainers by his <hi>Commerce</hi> with that Kingdom, where all the <hi>Treaſure</hi> lyes.</p>
                     <p>Yea thus the pooreſt <hi>Subject</hi> may make his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Countrey</hi> Beholden to him, for <hi>Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating</hi> Judgments; and Praying down Mercies upon the <hi>Publick.</hi> Thus the Supplicants that Wait upon Gods Throne, not only Deliver their <hi>own Souls,</hi> but help to Save <hi>Nations,</hi> 2 Chron. 7.14. <hi>If my People that are called by my Name, ſhall Humble themſelves and Pray, and ſeek my Face, and turn from their wicked ways, then will I Hear from Heaven, and Forgive their Sins, and will Heal the Land.</hi> Such a man the Lord ſought for, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30. <hi>That ſhould make up the Hedge, and Stand in the Gap before him, for the Land: that he ſhould not Deſtroy it.</hi> And becauſe he found none, (And then the Caſe is Sad indeed, when we are left to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:151193:69"/>as Iſai. 64.11. <hi>There is none that Calleth upon thy Name, that ſtirreth up himſelf to take hold of Thee.) Therefore he Pour'd out his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and Conſumed them,</hi> v. 31. By which it appears, both how Acceptable ſuch <hi>Interceſſion</hi> is to God. (He Seeks for the <hi>Interceſſor,</hi> and does not Blame a <hi>Poor Creature</hi> for taking ſo much upon him:) And alſo how <hi>Availahle</hi> is the Righteous mans Prayer, not only for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for all his <hi>Neighbours</hi> far and wide, <hi>Elias,</hi> (<hi>the Chariot and Horſemen of</hi> Iſrael) with the Opening of his Mouth, could <hi>Shut</hi> and <hi>Open Heaven.</hi> Jam. 5.17, 18.

                     <p>This is the beſt of all <hi>Friendſhip</hi> to our Friends, To be thus <hi>Concerned</hi> and <hi>Imployed</hi> for them.

They can make bold to take all <hi>Looſe Liberties</hi> in their Converſation and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and go ſo far this way, that they muſt be men of <hi>Large Conſciences</hi> indeed, and have as Little of God's holy <hi>Fear,</hi> that dare venture

And make heavy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and <hi>Tragical</hi> Exclamations of the inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Boldneſs and <hi>Laxity</hi> of all that are not ſuch high <hi>Obſervers</hi> of Times and Places, Words and Forms, Geſtures and Cuſtoms, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Nor jog along juſt in their very <hi>Mode.</hi> As if every one had loſt his way, and none could poſſibly be <hi>Saved,</hi> that did not exactly <hi>like</hi> them.

                        <p>But St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that zealous <hi>Aſſertor</hi> of God's Free Grace, (<hi>Gratiae Specialis Pugil.</hi> Bradward.) did not think it an <hi>idle</hi> Exhortation, when he call'd on his People, To <hi>Work out their own Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with Fear and Trembling;</hi> Thô at the ſame time he told them, It was <hi>God that workt in them to Will and to Do, of his good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> Indeed, if I muſt ſpeak my own Senſe, I cannot but think my ſelf the more <hi>Concerned</hi> to live and keep in his holy Fear, when I believe all that ever concerns me, lies in his All-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Hands.</hi> And I count it to very great and good Purpoſe, to Beg hard of Him for his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Aids,</hi> without whom <hi>I can do Nothing.</hi> I ſhall leave them who think nothing is to be Askt, which is given <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> by vertue of God's <hi>Decree,</hi> to conſider what room they leave for their Prayers: When as themſelves hold, That God has Abſolutely <hi>Determined</hi> to give to every one Grace <hi>Sufficient</hi> to Believe, and upon their Believing, to Endure to the end and be Saved: And that beyond this Sufficient Grace, Nothing is to be <hi>Sought of God,</hi> only they are to exert the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:151193:78"/>Power received, and to <hi>Stir up the Grace of God that is in them.</hi> And ſo according to their own declared <hi>Sentiments</hi> in this matter, What ſhould they <hi>Beg</hi> for that, which they believe is <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently</hi> Secured to them?</p>
                        <p>Again, I grant, that <hi>God knows</hi> the whole of thy Caſe, and how every thing is with thee, Better than thou canſt tell him. But then thou art to remember, That the end of thy Praying is not to <hi>Inform</hi> God of what he does not Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: but to Diſpoſe and <hi>Qualify</hi> thee to receive what he has promiſed to <hi>Give:</hi> To perform the <hi>Condition,</hi> on thy part to be performed, To Humble thy Soul, and Raiſe up thy Heart, and Enflame thy Affections, and <hi>Open thy Month wide, that he may fill it.</hi> The Promiſe is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they that Hunger and Thirſt after Righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> Now thy fervent Praying argues ſuch <hi>Hungering and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,</hi> and ſo prepares thee for the Mercy, <hi>Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles</hi> thee to it, and tends to <hi>Aſſure</hi> thee of it. But it is a <hi>Tempting of the Lord thy God,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his <hi>Immediate Aids,</hi> without thy uſe of his <hi>Means.</hi> And what if the Deſpiſer of <hi>Prayer</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the <hi>Fulneſs of the World,</hi> and live in all Pomp and pleaſure and Proſperity? And the looſe <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves,</hi> that Worſhips no God, but his <hi>Fortune</hi> and his <hi>Belly,</hi> is aforehand with many of God's daily <hi>Orators,</hi> for the Sweet and Brave <hi>Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi> of this Life? Be ſure, <hi>The World's Good</hi> ſhall never do them any <hi>Good,</hi> who Snatch it without God's <hi>Leave,</hi> and devour his Comforts,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:151193:79"/>without Asking his <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> For the Creatures are <hi>Sanctified by the Word of God and Prayer.</hi> And the very Bleſſings are <hi>Curſed,</hi> to them that have them, without <hi>Calling upon the Lord</hi> for them. Who have them on eaſier terms, than the <hi>Expence</hi> of their Prayers, Or at leaſt, do not ſo <hi>Sanctify</hi> them upon the Receit, ſhall have ſmall <hi>Joy</hi> of them; but will find them inſtead of Proſperous Gifts, only <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Snares.</hi> Better indeed Ask and not Receive, than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and not Ask. For Prayer coming between our Neceſſity and God's Bounty, keeps the good Underſtanding, and fair <hi>Correſpondence</hi> between us and Heaven, which is an Advantage of the higheſt conſideration. But then for the <hi>Better things that Accompany Salvation,</hi> (which are the <hi>Childrens Bread,</hi>) we muſt never expect them, till, we are qualified as Children, going to our <hi>Father</hi> for them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>Iſaiah</hi> very <hi>Bold,</hi> to ſay, the <hi>Lord was found of them that Sought him not.</hi> Rom. 10.20. However <hi>Liberal</hi> He is, to Beſtow ſuch Favours, Yet he is not <hi>Prodigal,</hi> to throw them away upon ſuch as count them not worth ſo much as the <hi>Asking for.</hi> We ſhall not be <hi>Saved,</hi> if not <hi>Sanctified;</hi> Nor can we be San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, without the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> nor are we to look for that <hi>Spirit,</hi> without our <hi>Asking.</hi> Luk. 11.13. 'Tis not to ſuch as Slight him, but to them which <hi>Ask Him,</hi> That God will <hi>Give the Holy Spirit.</hi>

                        <p>THE Church is the <hi>Houſe of Prayer,</hi> but not the <hi>Priſon,</hi> to confine it within thoſe Walls; nor the only Houſe where Prayer is to

In the Word God Serves us; In our Prayers, we Serve Him, or rather ourſelves upon him. And 'tis not what men appear <hi>Abroad,</hi> but how they carry the matter at <hi>Home,</hi> that is the main Trial of them. There they are apt to <hi>Perſonate</hi> others, Here they are <hi>Themſelves,</hi> and make it appear, whether they would have <hi>God,</hi> or themſelves to be <hi>

                        <p>But the <hi>Zeal</hi> which ſhould be <hi>Exerted</hi> in this Service, how commonly is it turn'd againſt it? Men <hi>Ill affected</hi> this way ſtand upon <hi>Terms</hi> with <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to <hi>Reaſon</hi> themſelves from under his <hi>Yoke.</hi> They cry out <hi>Impoſition</hi> and <hi>Slavery!</hi> and Twenty <hi>Evaſions</hi> to keep them off their Knees. 'Tis <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is all this Waſte? And O how glad of any thing like an <hi>Apology,</hi> to Superſede the <hi>Irkſom</hi> Imployment?

Nay he ſhall be even <hi>Ador'd</hi> as a Saviour, that comes to ſet them <hi>Free,</hi> where <hi>God,</hi> and ſome of his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> would tie them up.

When they ſhall be taught to Slight God with good <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant:</hi> and to ask, Who ſhall <hi>Confine</hi> them, where the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf hath left them Free? But they that are ſo ready to ſtand off here, for want of an Expreſs <hi>Command,</hi> are known too well, to be none of the <hi>Tendereſt,</hi> or forwardeſt men, to <hi>Follow the Lord fully,</hi> where his Word doth ſpeak out <hi>Expreſly.</hi> When they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>Walk in the Spirit,</hi> and by it to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the deeds of the Body:</hi> Yet who more Carnal and Looſe than they? By which we may too evidently perceive, That it is not ſo much out of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as for the <hi>Belly-God,</hi> that they plead and contend. They would have <hi>Elbow-room</hi> enough, to Expatiate after their Luſts, and a Way in <hi>Latitude,</hi> and Eaſe, and State, to Heaven, and not be Limited to that <hi>Narrow way,</hi> which they could never abide.</p>
                        <p>But doth not the Holy <hi>Scripture</hi> oblige us to Serve and Honour God in all our <hi>Relations?</hi> and to <hi>Recognize</hi> our common Lord in our <hi>Joint,</hi> as well as <hi>Perſonal</hi> Capacity? Not neglecting thoſe <hi>Conveniencies</hi> which we have to Adore him? Then how can the <hi>Houſholder,</hi> with his Family,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:151193:86"/>think themſelves Excuſed? If we are to Pray <hi>Every where,</hi> (that is fit for it,) Is the Houſe in <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> no where to be found? And ſhall we omit thoſe <hi>Inviting</hi> opportunities, when we Dwell together, and Eat and Drink and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe together, and yet not <hi>Pray together?</hi> How can the Maſter reaſonably expect <hi>Homage</hi> of his Servants, when he lets them not ſee him as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſerve his <hi>Maſter in Heaven?</hi> Men will not diſpute themſelves out of their <hi>Meals,</hi> and their uſual <hi>Refreſhments,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth not determine juſt <hi>Where</hi> and <hi>When</hi> and <hi>How,</hi> they ſhall Eat and Drink and Divert themſelves. Nor will they ask, What <hi>Text</hi> binds me to go to ſuch a good Friends <hi>Houſe,</hi> and receive his Kindneſs? Or to go to ſuch a <hi>Market</hi> or <hi>Fair,</hi> to Buy and Sell and get Gain? They can go <hi>Without</hi> a Command, and it's well, if they do not often venture to go <hi>Againſt</hi> the plaineſt Commands, for their Bodily pleaſure, and their Worldly profit. And then what is wanting but the Spiritual <hi>Appetite,</hi> to Savour and reliſh the things of <hi>God's Spirit,</hi> as good a Stomach to the Food of their <hi>Souls,</hi> and as great a Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their <hi>Eternal Advantage,</hi> to Determine their Choice and Practice this way? And to make them flock as faſt to the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> and to ſee that all their Houſes be <hi>Houſes of Prayer.</hi> A dear <hi>Love</hi> to the Service would be above all <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> in the World for it. And aſſoon as any are <hi>Quickned in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and become <hi>Alive unto God,</hi> they will ſave us the labour of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:151193:87"/>them, to go and <hi>Feaſt</hi> their Souls with Him, and to join in the Sacrifice wherewith he is well-pleaſed.</p>
                        <p>Whatever <hi>Short cuts</hi> ſome may fancy to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and laugh at the <hi>Round-about-way</hi> of Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening Prayer: I never heard of any <hi>Dying man</hi> that was of that mind. How many then do ſadly Bewail it, that they had not taken this courſe? So that the <hi>Praying Families</hi> are on the Sureſt Side, all muſt acknowledge: And they may be infinite <hi>Gainers:</hi> But for certain they can never <hi>Loſe</hi> by this Service. When it looks like <hi>Loitering</hi> by the way, and Hindring their work, Yet they are about their <hi>Heavenly Father's Buſineſs.</hi> And he that Imploys them in it, will not ſuffer them to Loſe ground by it. It ſtops them, but like a <hi>Traveller's</hi> Eating and Refreſhing himſelf, to recover <hi>Strength</hi> for his Journey. And poor people that cry, they have not <hi>Time</hi> for it, may more truly ſay, They have no <hi>Mind</hi> to it. For they can find Time for many matters of leſs <hi>Importance.</hi> And they had better abate ſome <hi>Gains,</hi> and themſelves be turn'd out of <hi>Doors,</hi> than graſp ſo much Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as to <hi>Juſtle</hi> Prayer out of Doors. But indeed Prayers never made any <hi>Beggars,</hi> unleſs it be in that Senſe, as is no <hi>Damage</hi> or <hi>Diſparagement</hi> to any.</p>
                        <p>The laudable Uſage of all <hi>Well-govern'd</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, To go to their <hi>Prayers,</hi> before they fall to, and after they have Finiſhed, the <hi>Buſineſs of the day,</hi> cannot be <hi>Confronted,</hi> without a Proud Scornful Reflection upon the moſt <hi>Judicious,</hi> and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:151193:87"/>the moſt <hi>Pious</hi> Chriſtians in the World. When the Family comes together in the <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening,</hi> This is the moſt decent way of bidding <hi>Good Morrow,</hi> and <hi>Good Night.</hi> And ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies as <hi>Give themſelves to Prayer,</hi> uſe to give alſo the beſt <hi>Examples</hi> in other matters, and ſhew that they are the likeſt of all to be in the <hi>Right.</hi> Indeed an ordinary Obſerver, (if any thing impartial,) may eaſily ſee the Difference that is Commonly between <hi>Praying</hi> and <hi>Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs</hi> Families. I ſay, <hi>commonly,</hi> for it is Poſſible, the Service may be kept up in a <hi>Perfunctory,</hi> heedleſs, and cuſtomary manner, without any Improvement to the Worſhippers: But then the fault is not at all in the <hi>Offices,</hi> but in the <hi>Way</hi> of performance: And they are <hi>Abuſed,</hi> like many other Good things, that men often uſe. without doing themſelves any Good in the <hi>

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:151193:90"/>be, doth not fit their <hi>purpoſe.</hi> And thô he bids them <hi>Keep holy the Sabbath,</hi> they have ſomewhat elſe to do, than to wait upon <hi>Him,</hi> and cannot a'while to be at his <hi>Beck.</hi> Let him be ready to receive them, yet they are otherwiſe Engag'd for that <hi>Time,</hi> and muſt put it off, till a more <hi>Convenient Seaſon.</hi> Or if they pay any Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> that muſt Attone for the Neglect, tho' he hear no more of them all the <hi>Week</hi> after. <hi>Sunday</hi> is enough, they think they have Served him well. It ſhall be When they Liſt, after their <hi>Capricious Fancy,</hi> and not according to his <hi>Divine Appointment.</hi> He ſays, <hi>Now is the Accepted Time,</hi> and <hi>Hear his Voice To day:</hi> But they think another time will Serve the turn, and <hi>Hereafter</hi> do as well, any <hi>Idle Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes</hi> that they know not what elſe to do with. Still they would put off for the <hi>Preſent,</hi> what they have no mind to do <hi>at all.</hi> 'Tis but now and then a little, as they pleaſe, and as the <hi>Toy</hi> takes them, that they do any thing like <hi>Serving the Lord,</hi> and do it in ſuch a manner, as if he muſt be much <hi>Beholden</hi> to them for it. They will not <hi>Engage</hi> in it, nor Tie to it, and be Conſtant at it. Only fome little <hi>Snatches,</hi> and wide <hi>Breaches</hi> between. They cannot Live a day without their <hi>Meals,</hi> but tho many days come between, they find no <hi>Want</hi> of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Tho <hi>Scripture</hi> tells them not, How oft they ſhall Eat or Sleep, yet they have their <hi>Set Times</hi> for both Meals and Reſt. But O where's any the like Care to <hi>Secure</hi> their Prayers! 'Tis
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:151193:91"/>only in a <hi>Fit,</hi> or a <hi>Humor,</hi> or a <hi>Fright,</hi> that they are for Praying. And if they have any <hi>Prayer-Times,</hi> Yet how ſmall a matter ſhall <hi>Break</hi> them? and take them off, to ſerve their <hi>Luſts,</hi> or any one, or any thing, before the great <hi>Lord of all?</hi> Only the <hi>Scraps</hi> and <hi>Leavings</hi> of the World and Fleſh, ſhall be thought good enough for his Portion. They are not at Leiſure to <hi>Seek the Lord while he maybe Found;</hi> but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what he ſent them into the world to do: and how ſoon they ſhall awhile to <hi>Dye,</hi> and a'while to go to <hi>Judgement,</hi> and a'while to Abide by it, in the Future ſtate <hi>Everlaſting.</hi> And amidſt all their other Buſineſs, if they mind not the <hi>One thing Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> above all, they had e'en as good have <hi>Slept</hi> out their Time, as ſo <hi>Beſtir</hi> themſelves in the World.</p>
                     <p>I know, many of the <hi>Labouring,</hi> and <hi>Buſy</hi> people uſe to complain, That their hands are ſo Full, and <hi>Buſineſs</hi> lies ſo hard upon them, they have not <hi>Leiſure</hi> to do as they would, every day, in the Greateſt and Beſt of all <hi>Works.</hi> So gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Intimations, what Mighty Matters we might expect from them, had they but the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities</hi> which ſome others enjoy.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:151193:93"/>It is as if no <hi>Sun</hi> had Riſen that day: and laves us worſe than without a <hi>Sun, Without God in the World.</hi> When Prayer ſhould be as the very <hi>Pulſe</hi> of our Souls.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:151193:96"/>Awake, doing nothing <hi>Heartily, as to the Lord:</hi> Yea when their buſineſs is not to Meet and Enjoy the <hi>Lord,</hi> but like ſuch as Viſit only out of a <hi>Formality,</hi> and not for any <hi>Cordial</hi> Friendſhip, care not if the Perſon be at <hi>Home,</hi> or no, ſo that they have performed the <hi>Task:</hi> They do but <hi>Take the Name of God in Vain,</hi> and take on them to Worſhip.

When the Supplicants have no concern, either to <hi>Prepare</hi> the heart for Prayer, or to keep it <hi>Intent</hi> upon the work in Praying: When they preſumptuouſly go forth in their own <hi>Strength,</hi> and ruſh upon the Service, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they are going about: And when fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len upon it, they mind not whither the Heart <hi>Roves</hi> and gads: Let the <hi>Tempter</hi> Jog and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt them, as the <hi>Pythoneſs</hi> did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he went to Prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.16. Yet they take no care to ſeize, and call in the <hi>Vagabond</hi> Thoughts: Then the Prayer is nothing elſe, but only ſo much <hi>Said,</hi> and a <hi>Huddle</hi> of Words pour'd out into the empty Air: Of no Significancy at all, but only to Accuſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, for making ſo Bold with the <hi>Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of Hearts,</hi> To lie Babbling in his Preſence, and make but a Noiſe, as <hi>Sounding Braſs, and the Tinkling Cimbal:</hi> Yea, and commit a ſort of <hi>Perjury,</hi> Invocating the <hi>Deity,</hi> to witneſs but

Whether God's holy <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> ſet us a going? and whether the <hi>Pleaſing</hi> of his Will, the <hi>Honouring</hi> of his Name, and the attaining of his <hi>Favour,</hi> to be made <hi>Liker</hi> and to be brought <hi>Nearer</hi> to Him, be our grand Aim and Intention.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:151193:105"/>But the queſtion is, What <hi>Service</hi> is thus done to Religion? And how much Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a <hi>Gainer</hi> by it? We know how Strict and Nice were the <hi>Phariſees</hi> for the <hi>Out-ſide Religion,</hi> Tho none had fouler <hi>In-ſides</hi> than they. Who more took upon them to Quarrel even with <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf! And would be Holier than the <hi>Holy One of God.</hi> Who more <hi>Bitter</hi> againſt <hi>Better men</hi> than themſelves? And what a mad Zeal had <hi>Paul</hi> this way, before his Converſion?

The very Worſt man that cries up their <hi>Form,</hi> ſhall pleaſe them better, than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt Chriſtian, that appears for the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi> it ſelf. And this makes the <hi>Romiſh Worſhip</hi> ſo Agreeable to <hi>Licentious Livers,</hi> That the Offices may go on, and the <hi>Heart</hi> be otherwiſe taken up the while.

To <hi>Stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize</hi> Perſons, and <hi>Ridicule</hi> their Way, makes me never the Better, nor my Way, at all, the <hi>Lovelier.</hi> If I have a <hi>Zeal of God according to Knowledge,</hi> I may find room enough to ſhew my <hi>Strictneſs,</hi> without ſpending all the <hi>Mettle,</hi> in that which leaſt Deſerves it. The ſharpeſt <hi>Drolls</hi> are not the Happieſt <hi>Teachers,</hi> Nor is he the <hi>Beſt Chriſtian,</hi> that makes the <hi>Lowdeſt Cry</hi> againſt others. <hi>Satyrical</hi> and <hi>Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> Doctors ſhew too little of his Spirit, who was <hi>Meek and Lowly</hi> in <hi>Heart.</hi> But we may know whence the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> comes, that is <hi>Earthly, Senſual, Deviliſh.</hi> To call every thing that I diſlike by an <hi>Opprobrious</hi> filthy Name, and ſpend my <hi>Choller</hi> upon it, may ſhew that I want a <hi>Purge</hi> my ſelf. But where Contending Parties <hi>Overdo,</hi> in their Heats on both Sides, I do not think I am obliged to depart from <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Peace,</hi> to Side and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate</hi> my ſelf with either.

To think we muſt do nothing but <hi>Pray,</hi> is not to <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretch</hi> the Liberty of Prayer, but to <hi>pinch</hi> and <hi>Grind</hi> upon it.
